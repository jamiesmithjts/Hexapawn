# Hexapawn
Made in Unity 2020, my first real Unity Project

# Features
2 game modes, Hexapawn and Octopawn which use basic pawn movements from chess on a checkerboard. 

In both modes, the aim is to either get one of your pawns to the other side or to leave your opponent with no moves left. 

Can switch between modes in game and can press space to reset the board at any time. 

Currently a 2 player game with no AI.
